## MyFirstPlugin

A location for me to practice developing spigot plugins. Just for fun!

#### Compilation

TBD (I'm using IntelliJ to compile, and will probably include the output jar in this repo eventually)

#### Usage

Drop the .jar file into your plugins folder before you start up a spigot server.
